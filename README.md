__WILDLIFE MARKER__


This study aims to create a wildlife mapping system
that is simple, low cost, and relevant. This study utilizes the
customizability of Flutter UI development kit, along with a
compatible cloud database that has free to use services, to locate
and map out various wildlife species. A mobile application is
created to enable user to upload necessary data for locating and
mapping out various flora and fauna species, store the data to a
Firebase realtime database, show images a user has uploaded on
the app, and a web page to present all the gathered information
from the database.
